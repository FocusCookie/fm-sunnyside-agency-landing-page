## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Mobile-first workflow
- [TailwindCss](https://tailwindcss.com) - CSS Framework

**Note: These are just examples. Delete this note and replace the list above with your own choices**

### What I learned

Sometimes tailwind is not easy as going with plain CSS. I struggled the most with the boxes which have an background image and no content inside itself. In flexbox the height was set to zero. So it was a littlebit of trying align-strech and height 100% in the divs.
